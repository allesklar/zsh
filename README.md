# README

This repository holds my standard zsh config.

The ~/.zshrc is supposed to:

`source ~/.config/zshrc/.zshrc`

## Reference

+ Here is an excellent tutorial. Might be useful for me to adapt config to Linux. Ex. setting up colors in if statement and using color names in code. It's BASH but still helpful. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5RZWDLqifA
